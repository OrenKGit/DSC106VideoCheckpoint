# Six Degrees of Spiderman

A Marvel Comics Network Graph

## Introduction

Despite the Earth being populated by more than eight billion people, you are only about six social connections away from any other person on Earth. This is the crux of the small world phenomenon. Despite the sheer size of the human population and the vast variety of cultures and lifestyles, you are indirectly connected to all other humans on this planet through a short chain of social acquaintances.

Intuitively, this sounds impossible. How is it possible that you know someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows the President of France? Or a Tibetan monk? Or an Antarctic researcher?

To answer this, we can turn to the Marvel superhero comic books, which consist of the stories of thousands and thousands of different characters, who often interact with each other in crossovers and collaborations. The comics therefore present us with a full picture of each of these charactersâ€™ social networks.
